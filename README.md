# CSharp-Assignment1---Text-File-Reader
This program reads a specific text file and displays the contents in a table. 
In this program's scenario, I simulated a program that reads a list of employees' names, ID number, rate of pay and hours worked in a text file.
The program displays a main menu and allows the user to choose 6 options to sort the table in ascending or descending order. 
If the program does not contain the required text file, the program will detect it immediately.
